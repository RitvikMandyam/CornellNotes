# CornellNotes

Allows you to take Cornell Notes-style notes. Written in Angular. Began as my attempt to learn Angular, but at some point, I realized it's a decent app to take notes using, and it became my go-to.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ToDo
- Build tests - what kind of good app doesn't have tests? The kind written by a lazy college student like me during his free time, that's what kind.
- Finish documentation - I like to pretend my code is self-documented. I don't know who I think I'm kidding.
- Migrate saving of notes from LocalStorage to, like, Firebase or Google Drive or something - who even saves notes locally? Do you WANT to lose all your notes?
- Add a way to insert numbered/bulleted lists into notes.
- Add support for inserting pictures - who doesn't like pretty pictures in their long, boring lecture notes? Also, digital doodles!
- Add a way to quickly input mathematical formulae - no one wants to hunt around their keyboard for a sigma sign.
